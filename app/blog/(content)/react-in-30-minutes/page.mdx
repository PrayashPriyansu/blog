# Build a React App using Vite

Setting up a React app with Vite is incredibly fast compared to traditional methods like Create React App (CRA). Vite offers instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and an optimized development experience. In this guide, you'll create a React app with Vite in just 30 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn** (comes with Node.js)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Step 1: Create a New Vite Project

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new React app using Vite:

```sh
npm create vite@latest project-name
```

Alternatively, using yarn:

```sh
yarn create vite@latest project-name
```

Follow the prompts and navigate into your project folder:

```sh
cd project-name
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once inside the project folder, install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Or if using yarn:

```sh
yarn install
```

## Step 3: Start the Development Server

Now, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or using yarn:

```sh
yarn dev
```

&nbsp;
This will start a local server, and you can open your browser at the provided URL (usually [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) ).

## Step 4: Explore the Project Structure

A typical Vite React project includes:

```sh
my-vite-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/          # Static assets
â”œâ”€â”€ src/             # Source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx      # Main React component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.jsx     # Entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.css    # Global styles
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.js   # Vite configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json     # Dependencies & scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md        # Documentation
```

## Step 5: Check your Vite.config.js

Open vite.config.js and check if the react plugin is installed:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

This should be done autmatically by the create vite command.

## Step 6: Modify Your First Component

Open src/App.jsx and update it:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Vite React App!</h1>
      <p>Vite is blazing fast! ðŸš€</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Save the file, and Vite will instantly update your browser with the changes.

## Step 7: Build and Deploy

When you're ready to deploy, build your project using:

```sh
npm run build
```

Or with yarn:

```sh
yarn build
```

This generates an optimized production-ready <ILH>dist/</ILH> folder that you can deploy to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## Conclusion

Youâ€™ve successfully created a React app using Vite in under 10 minutes! ðŸŽ‰

With Vite, you get fast builds, optimized performance, and a smoother developer experience compared to traditional tools.

### Next Steps:

- Learn about **[Vite Plugins](/blog/vite-plugins)** for added functionality.
- Explore **Tailwind CSS** integration for styling.
- Deploy your app to **[Vercel](/blog/deploy-to-vercel)** or **[Netlify](/blog/deploy-to-netlify)**.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
